00:00.0 - 00:03.0,robot,Now I would like to ask you a couple of math questions.
00:04.3 - 00:04.6,participant,sure
00:06.0 - 00:16.1,robot,"If x equals four in next plus b plus log one equals 10 the question, is is the = 6 or B = 12?"
00:18.0 - 00:19.2,participant,Can you repeat that question?
00:24.7 - 00:25.6,participant,Can you repeat it?
00:29.9 - 00:42.6,robot,No problem my friend if x equals four in next plus feet plus log one equals 10 the question. Is is the equal six or B = 12?
00:55.7 - 00:58.8,robot,"I am sorry, maybe this question is too difficult."
,participant,ok
01:04.1 - 01:05.8,robot,If x equals four in the next plus V plus log one equals 10 the question is is being equal 6 or B = 12.
01:08.5 - 01:18.6,participant,B is equal 12
01:22.5 - 01:25.2,robot,ah! thank you.
