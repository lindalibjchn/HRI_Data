00:12.0 - 00:22.2,robot,"If x equals four in the next plus the plus log one equals 10 the question, is is the = 6 or B = 12?"
00:23.5 - 00:24.4,participant,Can you repeat the question?
00:26.5 - 00:38.4,robot,"No problem if x equals four and an X plus b plus one equals 10 the question, is is B equals six or B equals 12?"
00:40.0 - 00:40.3,participant,12
00:46.6 - 00:49.7,robot,"I am sorry, maybe this question is too difficult."
00:55.6 - 00:57.4,robot,really? please try again?
00:58.6 - 01:10.7,robot,Six is x equals four in the next plus the plus log one equals 10 the question. Is b = 6 or V equals 12
01:12.4 - 01:12.8,participant,B is equal six
